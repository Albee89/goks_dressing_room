# goks_dressing_room
A cute dressing room for underground king and all-round hunk Gok! Really enjoyed Steve Walson's codepen contribution Cute Cat Dressing Room and wanted to make my own with this- and Gok the handsomest 3/4 pug- as inspiration. My changes extend at this point only to the the design- but I will be adding on a judge's wig and detective hat for Gok as they very much suit his personality. Also gave the little guy a pretty Canvas firework background for practice/ no discernible design choice
